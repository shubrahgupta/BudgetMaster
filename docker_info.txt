1. After creating a dockerfile, build the Docker image: Open a terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run the following command to build your Docker image:


docker build -t my-fastapi-app .

#Replace my-fastapi-app with your desired image name.

2. Run the Docker container: After the image is built successfully, you can run a container based on that image:


docker run -d -p 8000:8000 my-fastapi-app

#This command runs the container in detached mode (-d), mapping port 8000 from the container to port 8000 on the host (-p 8000:8000). Adjust the port mapping as needed.

#Access the FastAPI application: Once the container is running, you should be able to access your FastAPI application by visiting http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

3. if you want to rerun the container i.e. the container is already created, dont use this again: docker run -d -p 8000:8000 my-fastapi-app

	Follow this: 
	a) First, you need to find the container ID or name of your existing container. You can use the following command to list all the containers:

		sudo docker ps -a

    	Identify your container in the list. You'll find its ID or name.

    	b) Instead of running a new container, start the existing one using its ID or name. Replace CONTAINER_ID_OR_NAME with your actual container ID or name:


		sudo docker start CONTAINER_ID_OR_NAME

	This command will start the existing container without creating a new one. You can now access your FastAPI app running in the Docker container.

	c) If you want to stop the container later, you can use:


		sudo docker stop CONTAINER_ID_OR_NAME

	And if you wish to remove the container completely, you can use:

		sudo docker rm CONTAINER_ID_OR_NAME
	
	#Replace CONTAINER_ID_OR_NAME with the actual ID or name of your container.
